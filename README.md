# Hello there!

Here you will find some research projects I have worked on as well as personal projects. 

I am currently a computational science post-doc at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 

- I have experience working in R&D at university, government, and industry settings.
- I am passionate about developing reproducible and open-source software to solve science and engineering problems.
- I earned a PhD in biomedical engineering from Oregon Health and Science University and a bachelors degree in physics from the Honors College in Portland State University.
- Outside of work I enjoy playing music, gaming, and hiking.
